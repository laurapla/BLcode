Simulation of the Beddoes-Leishman model as it is described in LEISHMAN, J., CROUSE, G., 1989, April. State-space model for unsteady airfoil behavior and dynamic stall. In 30th Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference (p. 1319). I am not completely satisfied with it. It seems to give decent results in some cases but also not-so-decent ones in other cases. I'm still trying to figure out if something is wrong.
