Simulation of the Beddoes-Leishman model as it is described in LEISHMAN, J., CROUSE, G., 1989, April. State-space model for unsteady airfoil behavior and dynamic stall. In 30th Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference (p. 1319). It seems to give decent results in some cases but also not-so-decent ones in other cases. I'm still trying to figure out what is wrong.
